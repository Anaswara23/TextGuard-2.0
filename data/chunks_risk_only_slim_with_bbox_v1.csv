Agriculture also contributes to soil degradation and biodiversity loss: approximately 17% of the Amazon biome has already been completely transformed (MapBiomas, 2023).",risk,"[""biodiversity_and_agroforestry""]",AGRICULTURE_AND_RURAL_DEVELOPMENT,train,Project Document - Disclosure_53233.pdf,3,3,"[{""page"": 3, ""w"": 612.0, ""h"": 792.0, ""rects"": [[108.0, 274.75, 522.02, 400.88]]}]"

Public training policies for owners of small and medium-sized businesses have become common around the world, especially in developing countries. Such initiatives are mostly aimed at increasing productivity, income, and the skills of more vulnerable workers. According to the literature, there are several reasons to believe that minorities benefit even more from these types of programs than non-minority populations. First, networks are generally an important asset for the success of businesses, and there is evidence that minorities have experienced smaller and less connected networks (Ibarra, 1993; Aldrich and Waldinger, 1990; Seidel, Polzer, and Stewart, 2000)1.

In the context of increased weather variability, better forecasts can benefit farmers through reduced losses, increasing yields and farmer income, particularly if these forecasts are carefully crafted to be relevant to farmers, including women and ethnic groups. 2.3 There is evidence that farmers adapt farming practices and investment decisions in response to weather information.

GANs consist of two neural networks competing against each other - a generator that creates fake data and a discriminator that tries to detect fake from real data. Through this adversarial training process, the generator learns to create increasingly realistic outputs.

A. Industry and Pollution Issues in Mexico 
2.1 In Mexico, industry accounts for approximately 26. 8% of GDP and generates 28.1% of the total 
employment in the country. Manufacturing dominates industrial production, accounting for 
20.8% of GDP, followed by construction, with 4.8%. Manufacturing is not only the most important productive sector, but is also the main source of exports, accounting for 87.3% of total exports in 2000.
1 The more prominent sectors in Mexico comprise the following percentages of 
the industrial related GDP: metal, machinery and equipment (21.5%); food, beverages and 
tobacco (19.4%); chemicals (14.6%); petrochemicals and plastics (12.2%).2 The industrial sector 
consists of approximately 300,000 companies, of which large companies are only around 1% of 
the total number of companies, with medium size firms making up an additional 1.5%, and micro and small enterprises comprising the remaining 97.5%.
3 Within the industrial sector, micro, 
small and medium enterprises are principally dedi cated to the production of textiles, clothes, 
plastics, shoes, leather, wood products, food products, glass and some metal products. 
2.2 The industrial sector generates a large amount of by-products, some of which are potentially 
harmful, but due to inadequate infrastructure, a lack of economic capacity and environmental enforcement, these wastes are often times simply dumped or discarded into municipal drainage systems, rivers and other waterways. According to the Federal Office for Materials, Wastes and 
Harmful Activities (Dirección General de Materiales , Residuos y Actividades Riesgosas), Mexico 
generates more than 752 tons of harmful wastes, wi th only 92 tons that are actually treated and 
processed, the remaining 660 tons simply being dumped.

B. Environmental Legislation in Mexico 
2.3 At the federal level, the overarching environmental legislation is the Ge neral Law of Ecological 
Equilibrium and Environmental Protection (Ley General del Equilibrio Ecológico y la Protección 
al Ambiente, or LGEEPA) . The principal governing body concerning the environment at the 
national level is the Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (SEMARNAT) , which 
was created in 1995. SEMARNAT, which is tasked with comprehensive environmental 
management, strengthened its structure through the addition of the Office of the Federal Attorney 
for Environmental Protection (Procuraduría Federal de Protección al Ambiente PROFEPA) , a 
decentralized agency in charge of environmental and natural resources law enforcement. In order 
to raise environmental compliance levels, PRO FEPA has undertaken to expand the coverage of 
its actions to include voluntary and market based schemes so that punitive enforcement by the 
government is not their only tools to achieve th e environmental and natural resource conservation 
objectives enshrined in the law (LGEEPA). 
2.4 In 1992, PROFEPA initiated the National Voluntary Program of Environmental Audits of private 
companies and public and private entities that constitute a source of pollution or risk for the 
environment. These environmental audits are de fined as a methodological test of installations 
and productive processes related to any emissions. Moreover, the audits function to evaluate the 
level of environmental compliance within the entity, including adherence to any applicable 
international agreements as we ll as good operating practices with the objective being to define 
preventive or correcting measures necessary in order to protect the environment that are 
integrated into an Action Plan. To date, the program has instituted over 1900 audits, of which 
PROFEPA has signed around 1580 agreements with entities in order to have them implement 
their action plan and correct any irregularities. More than 820 firms have completed their 
respective Action Plan and have received recognition from PROFEPA's environmental 
certification for ""Clean Industry."" PROFEPA is m oving to extend this clean industry certificate to 
numerous sectors of the economy and turn it into an internationally recognized green seal4. 
2.5 This voluntary audit scheme has been somewhat successful in boosting awareness among large 
firms in the private sector as to the benefits of pollution prevention and cleaner production. In 
SMEs, on the other hand, the picture is quite different, as these firms are notorious for not 
adhering to environmental legislation, mainly due to the fact that the legislation was developed 
with large enterprises in mind and has not been adapted to the conditions of a SME. Although 
PROFEPA is interested in trying to make thei r industrial environmental certification process 
more affordable for small and medium enterpri ses, these smaller firms, nevertheless, require 
alternative instruments to deal with environm ental issues that are based on principles such as 
ecoefficiency, cleaner production and environmenta l audits with parameters set at realistic 
levels.5 
2.6 In December 2001, the Mexican Congress passed a bill to reform the LGEEPA in order to 
institute a Pollutant Release and Transfer Regist er (PRTR), which will require firms to disclose 
publicly information about their pollutant emissi ons. Although this legislation is pending the 
signature of President Fox and the rules and regulat ions still need to be developed, it is expected 
that this requirement will have a profound effect on private sector firms and their environmental consciousness similar to the effect that the Toxic Releases Inventory (TRI) requirement had on firms in the U.S. Thus, the PRTR is expected to cause a surge in the demand for services and

programs such as environmental management and cleaner production techniques that will assist 
companies with minimizing their emissions. 
C. Cleaner Production and Industry 
2.7 Faced with this urgent need for improved competitiveness for industry combined with a growing 
concern for environmental degradation, more a nd more companies throughout the world have 
begun adopting cleaner production techniques in th eir quest to improve their competitiveness 
through increased ecoefficiency. Cleaner production refers to a management process that seeks 
out and eliminates the causes of pollution, wast e generation and excess resource consumption at 
their source through input reductions or substituti ons, pollution prevention, internal recycling and 
more efficient production technology and pr ocesses. Moreover, cleaner production is a 
conceptual and procedural approach to the production processes, requiring examination at all 
stages in the life cycle of a product or process in order to prevent or minimize the short and/or long-term risks to humans and to the environmen t. The objective of cleaner production is to 
avoid generating pollution in the first place, which frequently cuts costs, reduces risks associated 
with liability, and identifies new market oppor tunities such as the creation of environmental 
service companies to handle the recycling of waste products. 
2.8 Environmental management systems are proven effective vehicles to attain greater commitment from the industrial sector in striving for increasingly cleaner production. In this regard, part of 
the task is to develop alternative schemes to achieve compliance, away from only the traditional 
command and control approach, following the nati onal and international trend of establishing 
proactive companies. These companies, in turn , would then have the capacity to seek more 
appropriate routes to solve such environmental problems that are inherent to their productive 
processes, which then are reflected in incr eased competitiveness and a reduction in operating 
costs or such non-productive costs as fines, temporary shutdown, or even a permanent closing of a company, in addition to paying damages to th ird-parties or amortizing insurance premiums. 
2.9 The growing popularity of cleaner production a nd environmental management methods around 
the world is placing increased pressure on companies in the region to compete effectively. While large enterprises have led the way in raising gl obal competitive standards, thereby enabling them 
to achieve increased market share and profits, many SMEs in the region have lagged behind. 
Implementation of cleaner production methods presents a greater burden to SMEs-both in 
financial terms and in claims on other scarce resources. Traditionally, the implementation of cleaner production techniques has been viewed as a cost to the company, but this attitude is 
changing as enterprises are realizing that tremendous financial savings can occur through the use 
of cleaner production and environmental management techniques.

D. Cleaner Production and Industry in Mexico 
2.10 In Mexico, the demand for environment related ser vices is estimated to be around US$2 billion a 
year and is expected to grow at a rate of 8-10% per year.7 A recent survey conducted by the 
Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC) i ndicated that small and medium enterprises 
in Mexico place a high priority on training relate d to environmental standards and legislation, 
understanding of pollution prevention programs and management for preventing pollution. The specific size of Mexican industrial environm ental training market for small and medium

the demand appears to be the highest where comp anies perceive a direct economic benefit. 
""Ecoefficiency"" then, must be at the core of any incentive program to foster and promote 
environmental programs in both the short and long terms. 
2.11 A number of extension services exist in Mexico through government institutions (e.g. Secretaría 
de Economía, Nacional Fina nciera, etc.) and through chambers and other industrial organizations 
(e.g. Consejo Coordinador Empresarial - CCE and Confederación Patronal de la República 
Mexicana - COPARMEX) that offer support to industry in such areas as productivity, 
competitiveness, etc. in distinct parts of the count ry. These services are rather general in structure 
and are not tailored to provide specific se rvices related to cleaner production and/or 
environmental management - two areas that require technical expertise in order to be useful. 
2.12 In Mexico, SMEs have assumed a significant portion of the inherent costs resulting from the opening of markets due to economic globaliza tion. Without having benefited from new 
opportunities, SMEs have been subjected to increased competitive pressures and removal from 
many of the market niches where they had trad itionally prospered. The vulnerability of SMEs 
has also been demonstrated by their difficu lties with improving productivity and environmental 
performance, which has caused them to be even further left behind by the larger companies. 
2.13 The prevalent environmental standards and regulat ory instruments have generally been designed 
by considering the circumstances of larger compan ies. There are not instruments adapted to the 
reality of SMEs that recognize their inherent limita tions and potential and that offer tools to assist 
them with achieving compliance while maintaini ng a competitive edge. Available institutional 
support and suitable technologies have also been insufficient for Mexican SMEs, except for the 
work of the Centro Mexicano para la Producción Más Limpia, which maintains an institutional focus on SMEs.
9 This is all exacerbated by the lack of technical and business training that most 
SMEs confront on a daily basis and which represents a barrier to both their inherent development and competitiveness. 
2.14 Therefore, this project proposes to create and de velop cleaner production centers for the interior 
of Mexico, through the collaboration with private entities and/or local governments. The development of regional cleaner production cente rs has been tested and proven successful in 
other countries such as Brazil and India. These new centers in Mexico will be created in the North region (Sonora) and the Central region (Queré taro and Guanajuato). These three locations 
were selected based on the existing amount and typ es of industrial activity occurring in each site 
and the level of demonstrated interest among pr ivate sector entities such as industry associations 
and business chambers (e.g. CANACINTRA, CONCAMIN, etc.). Moreover, these locations have also been exposed to less activities related to cleaner production and environmental management, unlike such cities as Guadalajara and Monterrey, both of which have had programs 
targeting environmental management implementation (see paragraph 11.3) 
2.15 Building on the experiences of the Centro Mexicano para la Producción Más Limpia (CMPL), these new centers will provide cleaner producti on and environmental management related 
services to industry and other interested entiti es in the region through a more cost-effective 
mechanism. The CMPL aspires to serve a central role in the facilitation of development

The region effectively wastes one out of every two dollars allocated to public infrastructure investment due to issues such as cost overruns, time delays, and poor planning, among other factors (Suárez-Alemán, Serebrisky, and Perelman 2019; IDB 2020).

The pandemic exacerbated these issues, causing arrivals to plummet to 95,000 in 2020 and resulting in a -43.8% contraction in tourism GDP, dropping from 7.9% to 4.8% of the total economy. Recovery has been slow, with tourism's GDP contribution still 30% below pre-COVID levels in 2021 and international arrivals 42% below 2019 figures in 2022.

Recent unforeseen events, such as the unprecedented oil spill off Tobago's Atlantic coast in February 2024 and a shark attack involving a British visitor, have prompted tourism and emergency management authorities to reassess and enhance their crisis management protocols for the island. This reassessment is crucial in the post-pandemic era, where global travelers are particularly sensitive to perceived risks and require a strong sense of safety and security. Currently, Tobago's tourism crisis management is coordinated between the Tobago Emergency Management Agency (TEMA) and the Division of Tourism, Culture, Antiquities, and Transport (DCAT). However, the roles and responsibilities between these agencies are not formally defined, and TEMA's crisis management functions are not specifically tailored to the tourism sector.",risk,"[""sustainable_tourism_planning_and_zoning""]",SUSTAINABLE_TOURISM,train,Memorandum - Disclosure_73799.pdf,1,1,"[{""page"": 1, ""w"": 612.0, ""h"": 792.0, ""rects"": [[89.85, 461.85, 539.99, 486.78], [89.85, 499.79, 540.0, 600.62]]}]"

This resource limitation may restrict consultant deployment to brief diagnostic missions rather than sustained implementation support, potentially resulting in technically sound recommendations that lack the hands-on accompaniment necessary for successful execution.
